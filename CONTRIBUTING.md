Every contribution is welcomed! If you have an idea for improvements or new features, please submit a PR and I'll be happy to review it.

Please make sure you got [editorconfig](https://editorconfig.org/) installed for your editor, so we have the same indentation. Also, the source code is formatted using [prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier):
